									<p>What is the system to be designed is meant to do and in what context: 
In recent years, the UK alternative finance market has grown rapidly, leaping from £666 million in 2013 to £1.74 billion in 2014. SMEs, entrepreneurs, charities and other organisations that previously faced difficulties obtaining financing from conventional credit providers like banks are now obtaining funding easier as they look to other sources of finance such as P2P business lending, invoice trading, equity-based crowdfunding and so on. This is beneficial as the growth of the alternative finance market contributes to UK’s economy. 
</p>
									<p>However, even with such evident progress, more can be done to connect SMEs to potential investors faster and easier. We hope to come up with a financial portal to bridge the gap between these SMEs and people with the financial ability to fund them. We plan to focus on SMEs that have been established less than 5 years ago and have a turnover less than £10 million a year first. Our portal aims to help an SME that needs financing to work out where to get it. SMEs will be able to sign up for an account on the portal and use their webpage in the portal to pitch their product or service virtually. The portal will serve as a platform to connect with potential investors where they can exchange further details if interested to kickstart funding talks. In addition, the portal will match SMEs to different alternative finance sources based on a range of information parameters such as the object of borrowing, the terms of borrowing, the nature of the relationship sought with the lender, the risk level of the business activity and so on. All these will help to streamline the search process and match SMEs up with investors most suitable to meet their needs and vice versa.</p>
									<p>Initial problem statement: To help advance the growth of UK’s economy, the alternative finance market should be further developed to enable SMEs to easily obtain funding. However, there are currently very few platforms for SMEs to find sources of alternative finance easily and effectively, without the representatives of these SMEs having to spend time at multiple networking events to make contacts. Hence, building an online financial portal that matches SMEs with suitable credit providers will save time as well as collate the SMEs requiring financial funding and credit providers in a single database that is easily accessible for both parties.  </p>
