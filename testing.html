					<div class="title">Tests' Description</div>
					<div id="highlights" class="container">

<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Unit Testing</p3><br><br>
<p>Unit testing refers to the testing of certain aspects or units of the source code so that it is possible to check whether the functions of the code work as expected. Conducting unit testing will also mean that the code written will be easy to test and this translates to writing more blocks of focused functions that perform a single operation instead of large function that carries out more operations.
</p><br>
<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Acceptance Testing</p3><br><br>
<p>Acceptance testing is one of the last stages of the software development process where the software is given to its target audience to use to test whether the functions are working in order. The feedback received will be used to improve the software before it is released to the general public.</p><br>

<br>  

<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Regression Testing</p3><br><br>
<p>Regression testing is performed after changes have been made to the software. It is used to determine whether there are any new bugs or regressions in the software after the changes have been implemented. It can be done by running existing tests on the modified code as well as writing new tests for the modified code.</p><br>
<br>

<div class="wrapper style3">
					<div class="title">Testing Tool</div>
					<div id="highlights" class="container">


<p>By comparing different testing tools, we decided to use "Selenium" as our future testing tool for this project. Firstly, it can be used on different platforms. Secondly, it can create a browser-based regression automation test. Hence, we felt that "Selenium" is the most suitable for our needs for testing our final website. In addition, we will carry out unit testing on several parts including editing user information, searching by criteria and so on. Apart from using machine testing methods, we are planning to conduct acceptance testing by letting other people use our portal beforehand to receive as much feedback as possible on how we can improve the portal. 
In COMP204P, we did not use testing tools to test for our prototypes as our prototypes contain limited functionalities, and it would not have ben very productive to carry out tests on them. Instead, we have prepared a more detailed testing plan for our final website at the end of term 2.</p><br>

<div class="wrapper style2">
					<div class="title">Testing Plans</div>

					<div id="highlights" class="container">

<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Unit testing</p3><br><br>

	<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">1.	Test that all individual buttons are clickable. </p3><br><br>
		<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">2.	Test that all the pages in our application can be rendered correctly and viewed by the user. </p3><br><br>
<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">3.	Test to see if the CSS styling is working for each individual page by using the “inspect page source” functionality in the web browser. </p3><br><br>
<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">4.	Test to see if the information by the user is stored in a database by checking the database file. </p3><br><br><br><br>




 <strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Integration Testing</p3><br>
<p>After considering the complexity of our project, our team believed that doing it manually would be sufficient and timesaving.</p>

<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">1.	Test to see if all the links in the home page are working</p3><br>
<li>Clicking any link or button on the homepage should direct the user to another page with the exception of the “Home” button which would direct the user back to the homepage.</li>
<li>Clicking on the sign-up buttons as either SME or Credit Provider should direct the user to two different sign-up pages.</li>
<li>If the search button is clicked when the user is not signed in, the user should be directed to the page requesting him to sign up for an account.</li><br>


<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">2.	Test to see if user can register for an account by entering the relevant details.</p3><br>
<li>Signing up as a SME or Credit Provider should require the user to enter different details depending on whether the user is signing up as a SME or Credit Provider.</li>
<li>All details need to be entered in order to register for an account.</li><br>
<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">3.	Test to see if the user can log in to the website using the details that were just entered by the user when signing up.</p3><br>
<li>Test for both SME and Credit Provider accounts.</li>
<br>
<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">4.	Test to see if all the links are working after user has signed into the website. </p3><br>
<li>Used a similar checking process as ‘1’.</li>
<br>
<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">5.	Test to see if the user can edit his profile page.</p3><br>
<li>Make changes to existing information. After clicking on the ‘Save Changes’ button, the information should be updated and saved.</li>
<br>
<br>
<br>








<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Acceptance testing</p3><br><br>
	<li>Our team has asked a group of students to use our website in order to get their feedback on the website’s functionalities and visual aesthetics.</li><br>
	<li>Our team let students navigate the website on their own to get feedback on how easy it is to understand and learn how to use the functionalities of the application. </li><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>





	<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Regression testing</p3><br><br>
		<li>The functionalities for our website have not changed after the website has been developed, although there were some changes in the ‘CSS’. However, ‘CSS’ shouldn’t affect the testing code since it only alters the appearance of the website.</li><br>
			<li>If there will be changes in functionalities in the future, the testing can be simply carried out by editing the commands in the script. </li><br>

<div class="wrapper style1">
					<div class="title">Testing Results</div>
					<div id="highlights" class="container">

<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Unit testing</p3><br><br>
	<p>The website passed all the unit tests successfully. We did it 20 times manually in total and all the tests were successful for every round. </p>
	<br>

<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Integration testing</p3><br><br>
	<img src="images/testing.png"  height="70%" width="70%">
	<p>Green indicates that the test case is automatically tested, and there were no errors during the test.
From the picture shown above, the website successfully passed all the test cases and no error occurred.</p><br>

<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Acceptance Testing</p3><br><br>

	<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">General Comments</p3><br><br>
		<li>The layout of the home page is clear. The links shown allowed the user to easily understand which pages they will be directed to depending on the links they clicked.</li>
			<li>User could enter various details about their company in their profile page.</li>
 <li>The styling on the whole website is appropriate as it does not distract users from their tasks.a</li>
<li>The sequence of search criteria on the search page was easy to comprehend. </li>
<br>
	<strong><p3 style="font-size:140%;">Suggestions for Improvements</p3><br><br>
<li>The website could have more interactive features (e.g one user could add another user as friend and voice chat with each other).  </li>
<li>The website could have responsive designs such that the layout would be displayed correctly for all screen sizes. </li>
<li>It was not clear to users that search results are refreshed automatically without the need to press a search button.</li> 
<li>When editing some selections eg. nature of funding for the user’s profile page, the previous selection was not highlighted which would lead to some confusion for the user on what his selection is. </li>
<li>It would be more convenient for users if there was a way to search for a specific user in the messages page. </li>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><p3 style="font-size:200%;">Regression Testing</p3><br><br>
	<p>Not applicable as no changes were made to the functionalities. </p>

					<div class="title">Evaluation of PoC</div>
					<div id="highlights" class="container">

						<p>Based on our testing results, all functionalities of the application are working well concurrently and do not have any known bugs. Also, with our user acceptance tests, feedback has shown that those who had the chance to use our application generally agreed that it was easy to use and navigate. We have improved the application based on the feedback we have receieved as well, such as stating on top of the search page that search results are refreshed automatically. </p>

						<p>Also, with reference to section 2.5 (Criteria for Success), we feel that we have met all the criteria for success. However, we do acknowledge that there is still room for improvement but with our limited capabilities, we are pleased with the PoC that we have built. We have detailed the potential future developments for this application in the section 9 of this report. </p>
