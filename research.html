<strong><h2 style="font-size:200%;">1.Ruby on Rails</h2></strong><br>
<p2>Ruby on Rails is one of the most popular tools used for building dynamic web applications. It utilises the Ruby programming language. We will be using this for the framework of our application. It comes with gems, which are packages that contain code, documentation and can be installed to be used on projects. Different gems can be used to install different functions for use.<br><br>
We have selected a few gems and other aspects of Ruby on Rails that will be useful for us in building the financial portal.</p2><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Backups (Backup Gem): </strong></p2>
<p2>This gem helps to backup the database of the application. It can save the backup on different storages such as the local server, Dropbox and so on. In addition, the backups can also be compressed or encrypted using this gem.</p2><br>
<a href="http://backup.github.io/backup/v4/">http://backup.github.io/backup/v4/ </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Scheduling Backups (Whenever Gem):</strong></p2>
<p2>This gem will schedule automatic backups of the database as frequently as we want it to do so. This is to ensure that if anything happens to the application and it crashes, we can always manually restore the database to the last backup to minimize the amount of data lost.</p2><br>
<a href="http://eewang.github.io/blog/2013/03/12/how-to-schedule-tasks-using-whenever/ ">http://eewang.github.io/blog/2013/03/12/how-to-schedule-tasks-using-whenever/ </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Search Engine (Filterrific Plugin):</strong></p2>
<p2>This Rails Engine plugin can be used to filter lists when searching for something to make it easy for users to look for what they want.</p2><br>
<a href="http://filterrific.clearcove.ca/ ">http://filterrific.clearcove.ca/ </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-User Authentication: :</strong></p2>
<p2>We can use Ruby on Rails to model users and allow users to sign up for an account on our web application. In addition, they will be able to log in, log out and update their profiles as well. </p2><br>
<a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#code-cloud_server ">https://www.railstutorial.org/book/beginning#code-cloud_server </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Databases (PostgreSQL): </strong></p2>
<p2>Ruby on Rails supports most of the databases (eg. SQLite, MySQL) but we have chosen to use Postgresql as we plan to build and deploy our app on Heroku, which Postgresql is compatible with. </p2><br>
<a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql  ">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql  </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Messaging Platform (Faye): </strong></p2>
<p2>Faye can be used to build a real-time push server in our application, which will serve as our messaging platform for our users to communicate with each other. </p2><br>
<a href="http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-faye-as-a-real-time-push-server-in-rails--net-22600 ">http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-faye-as-a-real-time-push-server-in-rails--net-22600 </a><br><br><br>

<strong><h2 style="font-size:200%;">2.Django</h2></strong><br>
<p2>Django is another web application framework that uses Python as the programming language. Django is similar to Ruby on Rails as they both follow the Model-view-controller (MVC) principle where the modelling of the domain, the application’s data and the user’s interaction are all separate from one another. </p2><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Backups (django-dbbackup Plugin): </strong></p2>
<p2>We can use the django-dbbackup plugin to backup our database. There are two main management commands for this plugin which are dbbackup (which backups the database) and dbrestore (which restores the database to the latest backup).  </p2><br>
<a href="http://django-dbbackup.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ ">http://django-dbbackup.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Search Engine (Haystack): </strong></p2>
<p2>Haystack is a modular search for Django which can be used to filter for search results in a database based on the criteria given.
</p2><br>
<a href="http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/v2.4.0/ ">http://django-haystack.readthedocs.org/en/v2.4.0/</a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-User Authentication: </strong></p2>
<p2>Django comes with a user authentication system. It handles both authentication, which verifies who the user is, and authorization, which determines what the user can do using his account. </p2><br>
<a href="https://mayukhsaha.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/simple-login-and-user-registration-application-using-django/ ">https://mayukhsaha.wordpress.com/2013/05/09/simple-login-and-user-registration-application-using-django/ </a><br>
<a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/auth/ ">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/auth/ </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Databases:</strong></p2>
<p2>Django supports many different databases such as SQLite, MySQL and so on, which gives us the flexibility of choosing the most suitable database for our application. </p2><br>
<a href="http://pythoncentral.io/writing-your-first-python-django-application/ ">http://pythoncentral.io/writing-your-first-python-django-application/ </a><br><br>

<p2><strong>-Messaging Platform (django-messaging Plugin):</strong></p2>
<p2>The django-messaging plugin enables users to send each other messages privately. There are several functions of the plugin that will make it easy to put a “Send XYZ company a message link” on a profile page. </p2><br>
<a href="https://github.com/arneb/django-messages ">https://github.com/arneb/django-messages</a><br><br>

<strong><p2>We ultimately decided to use Ruby on Rails over Django as we both have more experience in using Ruby on Rails after utilising it during our Scenario Week 1 project and would feel more comfortable programming in it. In addition, there is a wide variety of documentation available on Ruby on Rails on the internet with many online tutorials that we can access to help us with building the financial portal. </p2></strong>

					<div class="title">Thinking From SMEs’ Point of View</div>
					<div id="highlights" class="container">
				    <ol>
	<li><strong>1.What motivates them to seek out the website?</li></strong><br>
	<li>-Unable to secure loans from banks, thus these SMEs look to other means of financial funding</li><br>
	<li>-Looking for an investor who may be more or less involved in how the money is used depending on what the SMEs prefer</li><br>
    <li>-Easy and convenient way to know of investors instead of having to attend countless networking sessions</li><br><br>
	<li><strong>2.What do they find on the website?</li></strong><br>
	<li>-List of investors who have signed up for an account on the website as well </li><br>
	<li>-The background and overview of these investors </li><br>
	<li>-Contact details of the investors, the website acts as a platform for them to communicate with the investors as well</li><br> 
    <li>-A search engine that narrows down a list of investors in accordance to the criteria the SMEs provide </li><br><br>
	<li><strong>3.What do they do once they have a set of ‘matches’ to follow up?</li></strong><br>
	<li>-Information will be provided about each of their ‘matches’ for the SMEs to read up on and deem them suitable for their needs or not </li><br>
	<li>-A way to communicate with these investors will be provided, eg. through a platform much like a chatroom 
    </li><br>
    <li>-Relevant contact details of these investors (email, contact number etc.) will be provided</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>4.How do they contact alternative finance lenders? </li></strong><br>
    <li>-Either through the use of the contact details provided or through the communication platform integrated with the website which will be much like a chatroom/ instant messenger</li><br><br>
    <li><strong>5.	What role, if any, does the portal owner play? </li></strong><br>
    <li>-This depends on how involves the portal owner would want to be</li><br>
    <li>-The portal owner can just be responsible for the overall maintenance of the website or he can be involved in verifying the investors’ background </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>6.How is the portal maintained?</li></strong><br>
    <li>-Backups of the database can be done daily</li><br>
    <li>-Safeguards will be put in place to make sure that if the system crashes, the database will be able to be restored to the last working one </li><br>

<div class="wrapper style3">
					<div class="title">Thinking From Credit Providers’ Point of View</div>
					<div id="highlights" class="container">
						<ol>
	<li><strong>1.What would motivate them to subscribe?</li></strong><br>
	<li>-	Successful investments can result in very high returns for investors</li><br>
	<li>-	Easy way to know about new and promising startups 
</li><br>
    <li>-	Convenient to access information about these new startups as it can all be found on one single website</li><br><br>
	<li><strong>2.	How would they subscribe?</li></strong><br>
	<li>-	They will be able to sign up for an account on the website while stating that they are an investor </li><br>
	<li>-	They will then have to answer a series of questions that will form the criteria that will be used to help SMEs search for suitable investors </li><br>
	<li>-	They will also have to enter a short paragraph profiling their background and what they do </li><br>
    
	<li><strong>3.What process checks would the portal need to make to verify the identity and creditworthiness of alternative business lenders?</li></strong><br>
	<li>-Verifying the identities and creditworthiness of these alternative business lenders will be tricky as does it mean the portal owner will have to work with banks to do background checks?</li><br>
	<li>-SMEs may have to exercise their own discretion when using this portal and be careful not to fall into a scam (similar websites are like Gumtree, Craiglist where there is no way to verify either parties)
    </li><br>
    <li>-	An alternative method will be for the portal owner to play a more involved role and only allow investors to have an account after they have shown proof of their financial capabilities to fund a SME </li><br><br>
    <li><strong>4.	What, if any, role would the portal play in facilitating contact between potential lenders and potential borrowers?</li></strong><br>
    <li>-Interested SMEs will be able to contact them through the website or through other means by the contact details they provide </li><br>
    <li>-They will also be able to contact SMEs through the same ways </li><br>
    <li><strong>5.What role, if any, would the portal play in anything other than facilitating initial contact between the parties?</li></strong><br>
    <li>-	Convenient and easy platform for SMEs and investors to discover more about each other before deciding to make initial contact</li><br>
